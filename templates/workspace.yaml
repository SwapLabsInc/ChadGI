# ChadGI Workspace Configuration
# Multi-repository workspace for ChadGI task automation
#
# This file configures a workspace that allows ChadGI to process tasks
# across multiple repositories from a single command.
#
# Usage:
#   chadgi workspace init            - Create a new workspace
#   chadgi workspace add <repo>      - Add a repository to the workspace
#   chadgi workspace remove <repo>   - Remove a repository
#   chadgi workspace list            - List all configured repositories
#   chadgi workspace status          - Show combined task queue
#   chadgi start --workspace         - Process tasks across all repos

# Workspace metadata

# Processing strategy for task selection across repositories
# Options:
#   - round-robin: Alternate between repos, one task at a time from each
#   - priority: Process tasks by priority across all repos (highest priority first)
#   - sequential: Complete all tasks in one repo before moving to the next
strategy: round-robin

# Base configuration that all repos inherit from (optional)
# Repos can override any setting from the base config
# base_config: ./shared-chadgi-config.yaml

# Repository configurations
# Each repo can be identified by its GitHub owner/repo name or a custom key
repos:
  # Example repository configuration:
  # owner/repo-name:
  #   path: /path/to/local/clone          # Required: Local path to the repository
  #   remote: https://github.com/...       # Optional: Remote URL for cloning
  #   branch_prefix: feature/              # Optional: Override branch prefix
  #   test_command: npm test               # Optional: Override test command
  #   build_command: npm run build         # Optional: Override build command
  #   enabled: true                        # Optional: Enable/disable this repo (default: true)
  #   priority: 1                          # Optional: Processing priority (lower = higher priority)

# Workspace-level settings
settings:
  # Automatically clone missing repositories from their remotes
  auto_clone: false

  # Validate all repos in parallel (faster but uses more resources)
  parallel_validation: true

  # Aggregate statistics across all repositories
  # When enabled, workspace-level stats are tracked in addition to per-repo stats
  aggregate_stats: true

  # Maximum number of tasks to process in parallel (default: 1, sequential)
  # Each parallel task uses its own git worktree for isolation
  # Use --parallel <n> CLI flag to override at runtime
  max_parallel_tasks: 1

# Timestamps (auto-managed by ChadGI)
